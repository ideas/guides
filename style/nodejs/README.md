## References

  - Use `const` for all of your references; avoid using `var`. This ensures that you can't reassign your references, which can lead to bugs and difficult to comprehend code.

  - If you must reassign references, use `let` instead of `var`. `let` is block-scoped rather than function-scoped like `var`.

## Objects

  - Use the literal syntax for object creation.

    ```javascript
    const item = {};
    ```

  - Use computed property names when creating objects with dynamic property names. They allow you to define all the properties of an object in one place.

  - Use object method shorthand.

    ```javascript
    const atom = {
      value: 1,

      addValue(value) {
        return atom.value + value;
      },
    };
    ```

  - Use property value shorthand. It is shorter to write and descriptive.

    ```javascript
    const value = 1;

    const atom = {
      value,
    };
    ```

  - Group your shorthand properties at the beginning of your object declaration. It's easier to tell which properties are using the shorthand.

  - Only quote properties that are invalid identifiers. In general we consider it subjectively easier to read. It improves syntax highlighting, and is also more easily optimized by many JS engines.

    ```javascript
    const example = {
      foo: 3,
      bar: 4,
      'data-blah': 5
    };
    ```

## Arrays

  - Use the literal syntax for array creation.

    ```javascript
    const items = [];
    ```

  - Use `Array#push` instead of direct assignment to add items to an array.

  - Use array spreads `...` to copy arrays.

  - To convert an array-like object to an array, use `Array#from`.

  - Use return statements in array method callbacks. It's ok to omit the return if the function body consists of a single statement.

    ```javascript
    [1, 2, 3].map((x) => {
      const y = x + 1;
      return x * y;
    });

    [1, 2, 3].map(x => x + 1);
    ```

## Strings

  - Use single quotes `''` for strings.

  - Strings that cause the line to go over 100 characters should be written across multiple lines using string concatenation.

  - When programmatically building up strings, use template strings instead of concatenation. Template strings give you a readable, concise syntax with proper newlines and string interpolation features.

    ```javascript
    $message = `Welcome back, ${name}!`;
    ```

  - Never use `eval()` on a string, it opens too many vulnerabilities.

## Functions

  - Use function declarations instead of function expressions. Function declarations are named, so they're easier to identify in call stacks. Also, the whole body of a function declaration is hoisted, whereas only the reference of a function expression is hoisted. This rule makes it possible to always use Arrow Functions in place of function expressions.

    ```javascript
    function foo() {
      // ...
    }
    ```

  - Wrap immediately invoked function expressions in parentheses. An immediately invoked function expression is a single unit - wrapping both it, and its invocation parens, in parens, cleanly expresses this. Note that in a world with modules everywhere, you almost never need an IIFE.

    ```javascript
    (function () {
      console.log('Welcome to the Internet. Please follow me.');
    }());
    ```

  - Never declare a function in a non-function block (if, while, etc). Assign the function to a variable instead.

    ```javascript
    let test;
    if (true) {
      test = () => {
        console.log('Hello');
      };
    }
    ```

  - Never name a parameter `arguments`. This will take precedence over the `arguments` object that is given to every function scope.

  - Never use the `Function` constructor to create a new function. Creating a function in this way evaluates a string similarly to `eval()`, which opens vulnerabilities.

  - Spacing in a function signature. Consistency is good, and you shouldnâ€™t have to add or remove a space when adding or removing a name.

    ```javascript
    const x = function () {};
    const y = function a() {};
    ```

  - Never mutate parameters. Manipulating objects passed in as parameters can cause unwanted variable side effects in the original caller.

  - Never reassign parameters. Reassigning parameters can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when accessing the `arguments` object. It can also cause optimization issues, especially in V8.

## Arrow Functions

  - When you must use function expressions (as when passing an anonymous function), use arrow function notation. It creates a version of the function that executes in the context of `this`, which is usually what you want, and is a more concise syntax.

    ```javascript
    [1, 2, 3].map((x) => {
      const y = x + 1;
      return x * y;
    });
    ```

  - If the function body consists of a single expression, use the implicit return. Otherwise use a `return` statement.

    ```javascript
    [1, 2, 3].map((number) => `A string containing the ${number}.`);
    ```

  - In case the expression spans over multiple lines, wrap it in parentheses for better readability. It shows clearly where the function starts and ends.

    ```js
    [1, 2, 3].map((number) => (
      `As time went by, the string containing the ${number} became much ` +
      'longer. So we needed to break it over multiple lines.'
    ));
    ```

  - Always include parentheses around arguments.

  - Place 1 space before and after `=>`.

    ```js
    [1, 2, 3].map((x) => x * x);
    ```

  - Avoid confusing arrow function syntax (`=>`) with comparison operators (`<=`, `>=`).

## Classes & Constructors

  - Always use `class`. Avoid manipulating `prototype` directly.

    ```javascript
    class Queue {
      constructor(contents) {
        this._queue = contents || [];
      }

      pop() {
        const value = this._queue[0];
        this._queue.splice(0, 1);
        return value;
      }
    }
    ```

  - Use `extends` for inheritance. It is a built-in way to inherit prototype functionality without breaking `instanceof`.

    ```javascript
    class PeekableQueue extends Queue {
      peek() {
        return this._queue[0];
      }
    }
    ```

  - Methods can return `this` to help with method chaining.

  - It's okay to write a custom `toString()` method, just make sure it works successfully and causes no side effects.

  - Classes have a default constructor if one is not specified. An empty constructor function or one that just delegates to a parent class is unnecessary.

## Promises

  - Build you interfaces using Promises. Instead of asking to provide a callback to your function, return a Promise.

  - Always use the native Promise implementation.

  - Don't define rejection handlers as the second argument for `then` calls, always use an extra `catch`.

    ```js
    const promise = execute();
    promise
      .then((data) => {
        // success
      })
      .catch((err) => {
        // error
      });
    ```

  - Flatten Promise chains.

## Iterators

  - Don't use iterators. Prefer JavaScript's higher-order functions like `map()` and `reduce()` instead of loops like `for-of`. This enforces our immutable rule. Dealing with pure functions that return values is easier to reason about than side effects.

## Properties

  - Use dot notation when accessing properties.

    ```javascript
    const value = atom.value;
    ```

  - Use subscript notation `[]` when accessing properties with a variable.

## Variables

  - Always use `const` to declare variables. Not doing so will result in global variables. We want to avoid polluting the global namespace.

  - Use one `const` declaration per variable. It's easier to add new variable declarations this way, and you never have to worry about swapping out a `;` for a `,` or introducing punctuation-only diffs.

  - Group all your `const`s and then group all your `let`s. This is helpful when later on you might need to assign a variable depending on one of the previous assigned variables.

## Comparison Operators and Equality

  - Use `===` and `!==` over `==` and `!=`.

  - Use shortcuts.

    ```javascript
    if (name) {
      // ...
    }

    if (items.length) {
      // ...
    }
    ```

  - Use braces to create blocks in case and default clauses that contain lexical declarations (e.g. `let`, `const`, `function`, and `class`). Lexical declarations are visible in the entire switch block but only get initialized when assigned, which only happens when its case is reached. This causes problems when multiple case clauses attempt to define the same thing.

    ```javascript
    switch (foo) {
      case 1: {
        let x = 1;
        break;
      }
      case 2: {
        const y = 2;
        break;
      }
      case 3: {
        function f() {}
        break;
      }
      case 4:
        bar();
        break;
      default: {
        class C {}
      }
    }
    ```

  - Ternaries should not be nested and generally be single line expressions.

## Blocks

  - Use braces with all multi-line blocks.

    ```javascript
    if (test) return false;

    if (test) {
      return false;
    }
    ```

  - If you're using multi-line blocks with `if` and `else`, put `else` on the same line as your
    `if` block's closing brace.

    ```javascript
    if (test) {
      thing1();
      thing2();
    } else {
      thing3();
    }
    ```

## Comments

  - Use `/** ... */` for multi-line comments. Include a description, specify types and values for all parameters and return values.

  - Use `//` for single line comments. Place single line comments on a newline above the subject of the comment. Put an empty line before the comment unless it's on the first line of a block.

    ```javascript
    function getType() {
      console.log('fetching type...');

      // set the default type to 'no type'
      const type = this._type || 'no type';

      return type;
    }
    ```

## Whitespace

  - Use soft tabs set to 2 spaces.

    ```javascript
    function () {
    âˆ™âˆ™const name;
    }
    ```

  - Place 1 space before the leading brace.

    ```javascript
    function test() {
      console.log('test');
    }
    ```

  - Place 1 space before the opening parenthesis in control statements (`if`, `while` etc.). Place no space before the argument list in function calls and declarations.

    ```javascript
    if (test) {
      console.log('test');
    }

    function test() {
      console.log('test');
    }
    ```

  - Set off operators with spaces.

    ```javascript
    const x = y + 5;
    ```

  - End files with a single newline character.

  - Use indentation when making long method chains (more than 2 method chains). Use a leading dot, which emphasizes that the line is a method call, not a new statement.

  - Leave a blank line after blocks and before the next statement.

    ```javascript
    const obj = {
      foo() {
      },

      bar() {
      }
    };

    return obj;
    ```

  - Do not pad your blocks with blank lines.

    ```javascript
    function bar() {
      console.log(foo);
    }
    ```

  - Do not add spaces inside parentheses.

    ```javascript
    if (foo) {
      console.log(foo);
    }
    ```

  - Do not add spaces inside brackets.

    ```javascript
    const foo = [1, 2, 3];
    console.log(foo[0]);
    ```

  - Add spaces inside curly braces.

    ```javascript
    const foo = { bar: 'test' };
    ```

  - Avoid having lines of code that are longer than 100 characters (including whitespace). This ensures readability and maintainability.

## Commas

  - Don't use leading commas.

  - Don't use trailing commas.

## Semicolons

  - Use semicolons.

    ```javascript
    (() => {
      const name = 'Dana Scully';
      return name;
    })();
    ```

## Type Casting & Coercion

  - Perform type coercion at the beginning of the statement.

  - Strings:

    ```javascript
    const value = String(input);
    ```

  - Numbers: Use `Number` for type casting and `parseInt` always with a radix for parsing strings.

    ```javascript
    const value = Number(input);
    const value = parseInt(input, 10);
    ```

  - Booleans:

    ```javascript
    const value = Boolean(input);
    const value = !!input;
    ```

## Naming Conventions

  - Avoid single letter names (except in loops). Be descriptive with your naming.

  - Use camelCase when naming objects, functions, and instances.

    ```javascript
    const thisIsMyObject = {};

    function thisIsMyFunction() {
      // ...
    }
    ```

  - Use PascalCase when naming constructors, classes, and imported modules.

    ```javascript
    const Fs = require('fs');

    class User {
      constructor(options) {
        this.name = options.name;
      }
    }
    ```

  - Do not use trailing or leading underscores. JavaScript does not have the concept of privacy in terms of properties or methods. Although a leading underscore is a common convention to mean "private", in fact, these properties are fully public, and as such, are part of your public API contract. This convention might lead developers to wrongly think that a change won't count as breaking, or that tests aren't needed.

  - Don't save references to `this`. Use arrow functions or `Function#bind`.

    ```javascript
    function foo() {
      return () => {
        console.log(this);
      };
    }
    ```

## Accessors

  - Accessor functions for properties are not required.

  - Do not use JavaScript getters/setters as they cause unexpected side effects and are harder to test, maintain, and reason about. Instead, if you do make accessor functions, use `getValue()` and `setValue(value)`.

    ```javascript
    user.getAge();
    user.setAge(27);
    ```

  - If the property is a `boolean`, use `isValue()` or `hasValue()`.

    ```javascript
    if (!user.hasAge()) {
      return false;
    }
    ```

  - It's okay to create `get()` and `set()` functions, but be consistent.

    ```javascript
    class User {
      constructor(options) {
        const name = options.name || 'n/a';
        this.set('name', name);
      }

      set(key, val) {
        this[key] = val;
      }

      get(key) {
        return this[key];
      }
    }
    ```

## Testing

  - Use tests with 100% code coverage.
